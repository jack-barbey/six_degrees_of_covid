# Six Degrees of COVID19

This repository contains the code I've developed for creating simulated social networks, passing a contagion through the network, and visualizing the results.

The code is available in interactive notebook format in `network_spread.ipynb`. But if you would simply like to run a simulation with your own parameters, the code is also available in `simulate.py`. Change the configuration options in `config.ini` and then simply run `python simulate.py`.

This was build using python3.7 and requires the installation of graphviz, which is available to install with Homebrew. All other requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`.
